        When it comes to blogging platforms, one of the first providers that will pop into most people’s minds is Blogger. Founded in 1999, it is one of the oldest providers still active. In 2003, it was acquired by Google and that change is still shifting the
        way users are working with Blogger. Blogger is relatively easy to use. It is completely free and you can somewhat monetize it through ads. Customization options are limited, so in the long run, expansion is not welcomed. It’s been present online
        for over 15 years, so many bloggers are familiar with it or already have tried it. If you want just a hobby blog, Blogger could be enough for you. If you want your blog to be taken seriously, we would not recommend it. down some costs, along with
        a custom domain, perhaps you should look into WordPress.org or other platforms.</p>
